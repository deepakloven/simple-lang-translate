That soul, baptized in the purity of the Himalayas, bears the name Deepak Tamang. From the rustic embrace of his village, where every sunrise paints a new narrative on the canvas of the sky, Deepak embarked on his journey through educationGuided by the wisdom of his elders and the boundless curiosity within, Deepak traversed the corridors of knowledge at his village school. With each lesson learned, he found himself drawn to the symphony of logic and creativity that defines the realm of technology. It was here, amidst the humble walls of his childhood education, that the seeds of his ambition took root."
